They may include, without limitation, the following actions: \n\nThe warning: The warning has no direct effect on the Account. You can continue to play without change. It is there primarily to warn you that you risk greater penalties if you continue to violate the rules of Dofus. \n\nThe one (1) day ban: The one-day ban is usually used upon the first substantial infringement of the rules of Dofus. It is the first step on the Account ban scale. \n\nThe three (3) day ban: The 3-day ban is usually used in cases of repeat offending. The 3-day ban will make you understand that you incur real risks by not complying with the rules of DOFUS. \n\nThe seven (7) day ban: The one-week ban is the most serious sanction before the final closure of the Account. It is generally applied in cases of very serious misconduct. When an account is suspended for 7 days, you must absolutely and finally adopt impeccable behaviour under threat of being banned permanently. \n\nDefinitive ban: The Account is permanently closed and you can no longer access it. This penalty is usually applied in cases of recurrence or of serious or unforgivable disregard for the rules of DOFUS. \n\n8.3 The company reserves the right to impose any penalty on an Account, given the gravity of the violation, without first giving notice of or applying a penalty of shorter duration in advance. You agree that sanctions are final and you cannot in any way challenge the decisions taken by the Company.\n\n8.4 The Company reserves the right to change Account names, the nickname, character names and guild names that do not comply with the rules set forth above and those that are deemed unsuitable by the Company. The Company may also temporarily or permanently suspend access to the Account or delete a guild, without compensation.\n\n8.5 In addition to the penalties described above, the Company will take appropriate sanctions, including civil prosecution and criminal proceedings against the offender.\n\n8.6 Except as otherwise provided in these TOU or through an exceptional arrangement with the Company, there will be no refund if the Account is cancelled before the end of the subscription period.","ui.shortcuts.shiftValid":"Group channel message","ui.popup.warningForbiddenLink":"You have just received an Internet or e-mail address.\nIt may be an attempt to steal your DOFUS account.<br>\nYou should ONLY give out your login details on the official website: <b><a href=\"http://www.dofus.com\"><u><font color='#ffd376'>www.dofus.com</font></u></a></b>.<br> \nBe careful, some websites attempt to copy the appearance of the official DOFUS websites.

The Volunteers are voluntary players chosen by the manager of the Volunteer team (The “Ankama Official”) to manage the moderation and animation of the DOFUS game and in the forum dedicated to DOFUS (the “Voluntary Activity”). To ensure their success, the Volunteers have several tools (the “Tools”) and means of communication (the “Means of Communication”) at their disposal, provided by Ankama.\n\nThe Tools, in direct interaction with the community of players, allow, among other things, controlling these players' actions and intervening in cases where the rules are not being respected, especially the T&Cs, which govern the use of the DOFUS game and its dedicated forum (hereafter referred to as the “Services”).\n\nThe Means of Communication allow the Volunteers to act as a direct link between the Ankama Group and the players' community. Thus, they must be used with rigor and professionalism in order to protect Ankama's brand identity and ensure a good experience for the users. \n\n1.2 Thus, this Charter defines the contractual relationships between You and the Ankama Group in the context of your Voluntary Activity. \n\n\n\n2.\tAcceptance of the Charter\n\n\n2.1 By accepting the position of Volunteer and by using the Means of Communication, You commit to respect all the rules stipulated in this Charter. \n\n2.2 In case of disagreement with these rules and clauses, You shall stop performing your Volunteer duties by informing your Ankama Official, and stop accessing the Tools and Means of Communication provided in the framework of your Voluntary Activity.\n\n2.3 Undertaking any action that is in violation of any clause of this Charter will lead to your immediate withdrawal from the volunteer team and may result in sanctions, up to and including permanent banishment of your personal Ankama accounts. \n\n2.4 If any clause of this Contract is held to be invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, the invalid or unenforceable wording shall be treated as if it did not exist.\n\n\n3.\tNon-disclosure agreement\n\n\n3.1 As a member of the DOFUS volunteer team, You contribute to the execution of the game and are entrusted with some sensitive and confidential information (tools, methods, projects, etc.).\n\nYou are strictly forbidden to reveal any information obtained through your Voluntary Activity, without the prior consent of your Ankama Official. \n\nIn case of termination of your Voluntary Activity, this article will still apply and you shall respect the terms of this confidentiality agreement in all circumstances. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of this Charter. \n\n3.2 The anonymity of a Volunteer is crucial to ensure the success of his/her tasks. The in-game and real-life identity of a Volunteer, as well as any other information relative to the Volunteer or other members of the Volunteer team, must never be revealed under any circumstances upon pains of dismissal and sanction as defined in clause 2.3.  \n\n\n4.\tVolunteer's duties \n\n\n4.1 As a Volunteer, You are under the leadership of an Ankama Official who is responsible for the successful conduct of your tasks. You should respect their instructions and put to action the guidelines explained within in the framework of your Voluntary Activity. \n\n4.2 The Tools you use and actions you take while completing your Voluntary Activity will be verified on a regular basis. You shall thoroughly follow all directions given with these Tools and ensure the Tools are updated whenever there is a new version available. \n\nFurthermore, you should use the different platforms of communication recommended by your Ankama Official (IRC, forums, etc.), report any important problem related to your Voluntary Activity, and inform yourself about the activities and evolution of the team. \n\n4.3 Once you have been accepted as a member of the Volunteer team, you'll be asked to choose a nickname that is not related to your in-game or real-life identity. This nickname will be used in the framework of your Voluntary Activity only. \n\n4.4 As a Volunteer, You should behave in an exemplary fashion. Therefore, when using the Means of Communication, You agree  to write in a correct and understandable language. Insulting, offensive, racist, defamatory, homophobic, or xenophobic words are strictly forbidden when using the Means of Communication. \n\n4.5 You agree not to abuse the Tools and Means of Communication. You agree not to take advantage of your Volunteer position, especially in respect to the DOFUS game, either for your own profit or for the profit of a third party. \n\n4.6 The Volunteer commits to stay neutral, objective and impartial in the use of the Tools and Means of Communication. No measure should be taken for personal reasons. \n\n4.7 you commit not to claim any financial or in-kind compensation for your Voluntary Activity. You are forbidden to present yourself as an Ankama employee.","ui.asia.link.ankaboxLastMessage":"https://ankabox.dofus.jp/gateway/lastmessage","ui.asia.link.ankaboxLastMessageLocal":"https://ankabox.test.dofus.jp/gateway/lastmessage","ui.legal.title.tou":"Legal Notice","ui.fightend.malus":"Penalties","ui.asia.link.ankaboxSend":"https://ankabox.dofus.jp/gateway/create","ui.asia.link.ankaboxPortalLocal":"https://ankabox.dofus.jp/gateway/inbox","ui.tooltip.questMarker":"Mark on the map","ui.criterion.noguild":"Do not belong to a guild","ui.criterion.hasGuild":"Belong to a guild","ui.criterion.hasValidGuild":"Belong to a valid guild","ui.popup.accessDenied.toomanyonip":"There are too many connections from your IP address.","ui.storage.getExisting":"Transfer existing items","ui.storage.getVisible":"Transfer visible items","ui.storage.advancedTransferts":"Advanced transfers","ui.party.following":"You are following %1","ui.mount.filterNeedLove":"Needs Love","ui.mount.filterImmature":"Immature","ui.mount.filterNegativeSerenity":"Negative serenity","ui.craft.notEnoughSlots":"Not enough slots available","ui.mount.filterPositiveSerenity":"Positive serenity","ui.storage.ownedKamas":"Your kamas","ui.storage.estimatedValue":"Estimated value of inventory items visible","ui.mount.filterNeedStamina":"Needs Stamina","ui.login.capsLockWarning":"Caps Lock is on","ui.exchange.warning":"Warning: unfair exchange","ui.exchange.estimatedValue.description":"Estimated value of total items and kamas exchanged","ui.exchange.kamas":"Kamas gained from exchange","ui.option.fullScreen":"Full screen mode","ui.asia.link.ankaboxPortal":"https://ankabox.dofus.jp/gateway/inbox","ui.item.noItems":"You don't have the required items","ui.item.secretReceipt":"The recipe for this item is secret","ui.guild.guildLevel":"Guild level","ui.asia.link.ankaboxSendLocal":"https://ankabox.dofus.jp/gateway/create","ui.fightend.sizeMalus":"There are too many of you to face this group of monsters.

Far from the vision of \"everyone is nice, everyone is friendly\", scams sometimes remind some of you of the stark reality of it.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we're therefore going to explain some of them so that you know the right time to say \"no\" once a scammer has you in their cross hairs.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Selling Spell Scrolls Cheap</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this scam is to announce a sale of spell scrolls at a bargain price in merchant mode with a position you need to go to. Once the scammer deems they have attracted enough players to the scene of the crime, he or she will go into merchant mode with Lightning Strike spell scrolls... that cost ten times less than at the Marketplace!</p>\n\n<p>The other players, too enticed by the idea of spending little to gain a lot, are then likely to rush over there and end up with an item bought at a merchant value that is more than ten times greater than its average price.</p>\n\n<p>So be careful to always take the time to check what you're buying!</p>\n \n\n<h3>Offering 10% of Your Kamas</h3>\n<p>This is the most common technique in DOFUS Touch. The scammer offers to give the target 10% of their total kamas. To do this, he or she starts an exchange with the victim and asks them to put all their kamas in exchange, then puts around 10% of the total in return and takes the deal. The victim does gain 10% of the kamas they had if they take the deal as well... but will also lose the other 90%.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to protect yourself from this scam is, as always, to be wary when a player offers to give you kamas!</p>\n \n\n<h3>Joe Bloggs, or... Joey Blogs?</h3>\n<p>Identity theft is a very deceitful practice. It consists of imitating the nickname of a well-known player whose close friends he or she knows, and from whom it would be easy to ask for goods. The scammer will therefore adopt the victim's nickname, create a character with the same physical characteristics, reverse or replace two letters in the original nickname, and contact his or her targets, demanding items or kamas.</p>\n\n<p>The choice is usually not trivial and, most of the time, it will be a person who knows the players he or she intends to take down very well. Whenever a friend suddenly demands equipment, you need to check their account nickname using the command /whois PlayerNickname in the chat window, which allows you to view accurate information about another character. You can't go wrong using this technique!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I Got Scammed... Give Me Back What I Lost!</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, scams are part of the game, and no one other than you, the players, has any direct control over them. In the cases cited above, the moderators will be able to intervene in the game and take action.

The professions of DOFUS Touch are divided into two categories: collection and crafting.</p>\n\n<p>Each character can learn up to three different professions and three magical specialisations (see Smithmagic).</p>\n \n\n<h3>Collection Professions</h3>\n\n<p>The collection professions make it possible to collect raw materials in the World of Twelve. For example, a lumberjack will cut wood and a farmer will harvest grain. To harvest a resource, you don't need any specific tools – simply touch the resource to be harvested (here for example, wheat) and, if necessary, select the right action (harvesting for a farmer, cutting for a lumberjack, etc.).\nThese professions still include a small part of crafting (consisting of making new items out of resources). A lumberjack can indeed make planks and a farmer prepares flour. To do this, go to your workshop and interact with the corresponding machines (the farmers' workshop, for example).</p>\n\n<p>You'll find your recipes in the \"Professions\" tab by clicking on the profession that interests you. These professions cost nothing or almost nothing to increase – if not patience – and the resources collected are very useful for the other professions, so they're easy to sell! It's ideal for a beginner character.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Crafting Professions</h3>\n\n <p>Crafting professions let you create items. A tailor can therefore make various capes and headgear! These professions require greater investment to progress, both in time and kamas, but they let you create more powerful items in the long run. As for the collection professions, you'll need to consult the recipes in your \"Professions\" tab.\nTo craft an item, head to your workshop and follow the recipe!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learning</h3>\n\n<p>To learn a profession, talk to the corresponding NPC who will begin your learning process. Here are the positions where you can learn the different professions:</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li>Farmer: [7,-25]; [5,6]; [3,3] in Incarnam</li>\n<li>Baker: [2,-16]; [3,0]</li>\n<li>Lumberjack: [4, 8]; [1, -25]; [3,3] in Incarnam</li>\n<li>Miner: [1,-20]; [-2,-3]</li>\n<li>Hunter: [1, 18]; [2, -24]</li>\n<li>Butcher: [0, -15]; [-29,-32]</li>\n<li>Fisherman: [9,0]; [1,-17]; [3,3] in Incarnam</li>\n<li>Fishmonger: [2, -17]; [14, 26]</li>\n<li>Alchemist: [5,-20] (quest); [3,3] in Incarnam</li>\n<li>Handyman: [-27,-59]; [-28,35]</li>\n<li>Jeweller: [0,2]; [5,-16]</li>\n<li>Shoemaker: [5,1]</li>\n<li>Tailor: own the tailor manual</li>\n<li>Carver: [3,-20]; [3,12]</li>\n<li>Weapons Smith: [6,-18]; [-1,2]</li>\n<li>Shield Smith: [26, -35]</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>It's possible to forget a profession using the profession delevelling potions available in the Marketplace.

Indeed, to get the items of your choice, you'll need kamas or Goultines! And to have kamas, you have to fight monsters (you win kamas after each fight), do quests, unlock achievements, but also sell items that are not useful for you. To sell these items, several solutions are available.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Marketplaces</h4>\n\n<p>DOFUS Touch allows you to access the Marketplace from any location and to buy a lot of items there. To open it, simply click on the icon representing a kama. You can also go there physically; the locations are the blue-circled icons on the world map. The Marketplace allows you to put your items on sale at the price of your choice and make them visible to potential buyers. Select the item to be sold, its quantity and price, and then \"Put Up for Sale\".</p>\n\n<p>When your item is bought, you can find your kamas in the bank. Warning: Marketplaces require a tax to be paid to put an item up for sale. In the Marketplace buying interface (accessible by touching the \"Buy\" button), you can consult all of the items on sale from other players.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Merchant Mode</h4>\n\n<p>Merchant mode is accessible by clicking on your character or by clicking on the bag icon. \"Organise My Shop\" allows you to choose what you want to sell and at what price. Select the item, set its price and quantity before validating with the \"Put Up for Sale\" button. The \"Switch to Merchant Mode\" button disconnects you from the game. A tax is required to sell your items.</p>\n\n<p>Players disconnected in merchant mode are recognisable by the bag at their feet and the \"Merchant\" identifier written after their nickname. You can visit their shops but also buy the items that are put on sale there. Merchants are limited in number on each map and prohibited on some, but there are also maps where the limitation is less restrictive. These are the Marketplaces, located on the map with the stall icon. The Astrub Marketplace is under the Zaap! You need to take the stairs to the right of the map.</p>\n \n\n<h4>The Trade Channel</h4>\n\n<p>Use the \"Trade\" channel (/b) to advertise purchases and sales to other adventurers. To do this, open the chat window (at the bottom left of your screen on iOS and at the bottom right on Android) and type \"/b\" at the start of your message. You can also speak in this channel by touching the star to the left of the chat bar and then selecting \"Trade\". It takes level 20 or higher to use this channel. Warning: repeated use of identical messages may be sanctioned. As soon as a player is interested in your offer, you can close the deal by initiating an exchange.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Combine Methods!</h4>\n\n<p>These three buying and selling tools can be used optimally to increase your kamas with little effort by concentrating on speculation! Keep track of the commonly accepted value of items on your server and monitor the Marketplace, merchants, and the \"Trade\" channel for good deals. Then put them back on the market at a much higher price, right away or a little later, and enjoy your profit!</p>","ui.helpWindow.category3sub1text":"<p>To begin your adventure smoothly with your new favourite character, here are some tips to follow to optimise them correctly and avoid a youthful mistake!</p>\n\n<p>To start with each class, it's advisable to optimise its damage by increasing one of the following four characteristics: Intelligence (Fire element), Strength (Earth element), Chance (Water element), and Agility (Air element). Each spell has its own element, so all you need to do is level up the spells that match the element you choose.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to damage, each element provides different bonuses:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Strength</b> increases Earth and Neutral damage. It also increases the amount of items your character can carry in their inventory.</li>\n<li><b>Intelligence</b> increases Fire damage, damage protection, and healing.</li>\n<li><b>Chance</b> increases Water damage. It also increases your character's Prospecting (a characteristic that increases your chance of getting items in combat: 10 Chance for 1 Prospecting).</li>\n<li><b>Agility</b> increases Air damage. It also improves your odds of leaving a lock zone, locking enemies, and getting critical hits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When your main characteristic starts to cost 2 points for 1, it's probably time to add a few points to Vitality, which will increase your character's Health Points (HP).</p>\n\n<p>Each spell's colour indicates its element: red corresponds to Fire, brown corresponds to Earth, blue corresponds to Water, and green corresponds to Air.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to equipping your character, the various lairs in Incarnam have what you need to progress to level 60.</p>\n\n<h4>Class by Class</h4>\n<p>The advice below isn't necessarily to be followed to the letter; you absolutely can start your adventure opting for different solutions. But if you're just discovering the DOFUS Touch universe, it's well worth reading it!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ecaflip: Even though the \"Bluff\" spell (that uses the Air and Water elements) is the one that gives you the most damage at the start of the game, pointing your Ecaflip towards the Earth element is nevertheless recommended for the rest of your adventure.</li>\n\n<li>Eniripsa: Slanting your character's characteristics towards the Fire element to optimise damage from the \"Forbidden Word\" spell and increase their healing is advised.</li>\n\n<li>Iop: Earth is a favoured element for Iops and will let you do huge damage with your \"Pressure\" and \"Intimidation\" spells.</li>\n\n<li>Cra: The Fire element is the most accessible because it lets you use three offensive spells as early as level 6 with \"Magic Arrow\", \"Frozen Arrow\", and \"Burning Arrow\".</li>\n\n<li>Feca: The Fire element is recommended to start your adventure with a Feca. In addition to increasing the damage from your spells and glyphs in the element in question, Intelligence will let you make all your elemental armour more effective.</li>\n\n<li>Sacrier: Sacrier is the only class in DOFUS Touch for which it is imperative that you use all your characteristic points in Vitality, as any self-respecting tank must. The thresholds for the other characteristics are much too high to be viable.</li>\n\n<li>Sadida: Initially, the Earth element is the most interesting one to exploit for Sadidas. In addition, the \"Sacrificial Doll\" obtained at level 21 can be an excellent source of damage.</li>\n\n<li>Osamodas: As with Eniripsas, the Fire element will let you increase damage from your offensive spells and also increase your healing. Since Osamodas gameplay is based on Summons, it is advisable to increase the latter, except for the \"Prespic\" that is mainly used in Player-vs.-Player (PvP) fighting.</li>\n\n<li>Enutrof: The Water element is a must when starting an Enutrof. In addition to increasing your damage from the excellent \"Coin Throwing\" spell, adding points in Chance will increase your character's Prospecting.</li>\n\n<li>Sram: The Earth element is recommended when starting a Sram. This path lets you use most of the traps in this class and do huge damage with the rest of the offensive spells.</li>\n\n<li>Xelor: The Fire path is one to favour when starting with this class. It will let you use 4 offensive spells (and not little ones either) as early as level 26.</li>\n\n<li>Pandawa: There are two options to optimise your Pandawa at low level – Fire and Earth. However, you'll have to wait a few levels before you can use several offensive spells in the same element.</li>\n\n<li>Rogue: For many Rogues, the Fire path is favoured because it lets you make good use of offensive spells and the Explobomb, Rogues' favourite weapon.</li>\n\n<li>Masqueraider: Masqueraiders need a maximum of Vitality points to exploit their shields fully. When it comes to offence, starting with the Earth element is recommended.</li>\n\n<li>Foggernaut: The Earth path is easier to handle at low levels because its spells have lots of range.</li>\n</ul>","ui.helpWindow.category3sub2text":"<p>Distribute your characteristic points in the \"Characteristics\" tab to improve your character's various stats: <b>Vitality, Wisdom, Strength, Intelligence, Chance, and Agility.</b> Each characteristic has its usefulness, so decide wisely!

It can be used directly with the NPCs in each Dopple temple.</p>\n\n<p>The third solution can only be used once. In a class temple, you can talk to the NPC who lets you fight the Dopples and ask to use the restat power. This will cost you a few doploons.

You'll have to find companions and face the relevant monsters as a group to get them.</p>\n\n<h4>Increasing the Prospecting Rate</h4>\n<p>To increase your chances of getting an item at the end of the fight, several (cumulative) paths are available to you:</p>\n\n<p><b>Prospecting:</b> this is a characteristic of your character that increases the probability of collecting drops. Some items give Prospecting bonuses directly, and 10 points in the Chance characteristic increase your Prospecting by 1.</p>\n\n<p><b>Challenges:</b> every time you start a fight, you'll be offered one or more challenges, that is to say, to win the fight while imposing certain constraints on yourself:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>using all of your AP or MP</li>\n<li>never healing</li>\n<li>always finishing your turn next to an enemy</li>\n<li>never using the same spell twice per turn</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you succeed in the challenge, you get from a substantial bonus in experience and drops gained.</p>\n\n<p><b>Groups of monsters:</b> The longer a group of monsters has remained on a map without being attacked, the more stars will be displayed. You can consult the stars of a group by tapping on the map once. Fighting groups with stars gives more experience and drops.</p>","ui.helpWindow.category2sub15text":"<h3>Damage</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to increase damage (e.g. through boost equipment or spells). These damage bonuses are divided into two main categories: <u>characteristics</u> (Agility, Strength, Chance and Intelligence), <u>Power</u> and <u>fixed bonuses</u>.</p>\n\n<p>One Power point is equivalent to a point in the Air, Fire, Earth and Water characteristics but will only affect your damage. Power will therefore not affect your Prospecting or your Lock, for example.</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li><b>The characteristics and Power apply as a percentage of the basic damage of a weapon or spell.</b> 1 point increases damage by 1%. Each characteristic increases the damage only in a specific element (Agility = Air; Strength = Earth & Neutral; Chance = Water; Intelligence = Fire) but the Power is taken for all of these characteristics.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>For example, a character with 25 in Strength and 25 in Power will see their damage increase by 25% on Earth spells and by 25% more on all spells; an attack inflicting between 21 and 40 Earth damage will thus inflict between 31 and 60 damage.</i></p>\n \n<ul>\n<li><b>Fixed damage bonuses apply at the end of the damage calculation.</b> There are generic fixed damages that apply to each attack element, basic fixed damages that only apply to the attack element used, and critical damages that only apply to critical hits from spells.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>For example, on a character with a bonus of 10 generic fixed damage, 10 fixed Fire damage and 20 critical damage, the actual damage of a Fire spell hitting 200 after taking into account the characteristics and Power will be 220 for a normal hit and 240 for a critical hit.</i></p>\n\n<p>To sum it all up with a formula:</p>\n\n<p>Total damage = base damage + base damage × ((Power + characteristic) / 100) + fixed damage bonus.</p>\n\n<p><b>Special cases:</b></p>\n \n<ul>\n<li>Some spells are exceptions and do not take into account fixed damage bonuses. This is the case of the Paralysing Poison spell (Sadida spell). Pushback damage is not affected by these two damage bonuses. Indeed, there are pushback damage bonuses and only these bonuses are counted. In the event of a critical hit, the damage calculation is done normally. If you have any critical hit damage bonuses, these are added to the end of the calculation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Resistances</h3>\n<p>Resistance makes you suffer less damage when you are the target of a close-combat spell or attack. They can be acquired through equipment but also through certain spells, such as Feca shields. There are two types of resistance in the game: <u>resistance percentages</u> and <u>fixed resistances</u>.</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li><b>Fixed resistances are deducted first from the amount of damage inflicted by the opponent.</b> There are fixed resistances for each element (Air, Fire, Earth & Air), critical resistances that only apply to critical hits, and resistances to pushback damage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>For example, if an Enutrof targets you with their Coin Throwing attack, which inflicts 150 Water damage, but you have 10 fixed Water resistances, you will only suffer 140 damage points.</i></p>\n \n<ul>\n<li><b>Resistance percentages are applied last.</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><i>For example, if a Iop targets you with their Sword of Fate spell, which inflicts 200 Fire damage after counting fixed resistances, and you have 50% Fire resistance, you will only suffer 100 damage points.</i></p>\n\n<p>Note: A player character is limited to a maximum of 50% resistance in each element, which is not the case of summons, which suffer from no limitations.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it all up with a formula:</p>\n\n<p>Damage suffered = total damage - fixed resistance - (total damage / 100 / resistance percentage)</p>","ui.helpWindow.category2sub11text":"<p>The lairs are mini-dungeons that will allow you to understand the gameplay basics of DOFUS Touch, but also to unlock equipment in the game.

Each spell costs a certain number of AP. You can't use a spell that costs more AP than you currently have. Your MP indicate the number of cells you can move across. Without MP, you won't be able to move. The number of HP is very important. If it goes down to 0, your character dies.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Starting a Fight</h3>\n\n<p>First of all, touch a group of monsters: you'll be able to see its total level as well as the theoretical experience that you'll gain by winning the fight. Then press \"Attack\" to start the battle! Place your character by touching the available cells in your colour (you can see what your colour is by looking at the cell your character is already on). When you're ready, press \"Ready\". Note that when you play in a group and each player presses \"Ready\", the fight starts and no one else can join it.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the timeline, where the portraits of monsters and characters are displayed, you can find out which of your allies or enemies will be the next to play and adapt your strategy accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Tip: you can move or minimise the timeline however you want on your tablet's screen.</p>\n                                                                                                                                         \n<p>When your turn starts in a fight, an orange gauge will appear above your spell bar as well as on your character's card in the timeline. This gauge shows the time you have left to move around and cast your spells. You have 60 seconds before the fight starts automatically, and between 40 and 55 seconds per turn – the value varies according to the number of Action Points (AP) and movement Points (MP) you have.</p>\n\n<p>In your combat timeline, an \"End of Turn\" button lets you end your turn when you've finished your actions (this is highly recommended as it keeps fights from dragging on needlessly).</p>\n \n\n<h3>Using Spells</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to the AP needed to use them, some other characteristics must be taken into account to use spells:</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li>Range (RA): indicates the minimum and maximum range (in number of cells) of the spell.</li>\n<li>Line of Sight (LoS): indicates whether or not the spell can be cast through obstacles (scenery and characters).</li>\n<li>Area of Effect: some spells only target one cell, while others target cross-shaped or circular areas, at a distance or around the caster, and others affect everyone in the fight.</li>\n<li>Number of Casts per Turn: determines how many times you can cast a spell during the same turn.</li>\n<li>Recast Interval: determines the minimum number of turns you must wait before you can cast that specific spell again.</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>You can organise your spells however you like in the shortcut bar at the bottom-middle of the interface or on the right, depending on your screen resolution. To add a spell, open the \"Spells\" tab and slide the spell you want into the chosen cell. To remove a spell or change its location, touch the green padlock on your spell bar. Then move the icons by dragging and dropping them wherever you want.\nTo cast a spell during combat, nothing could be simpler: drag the spell you want to use from your shortcut bar onto the target. The target must be within the chosen spell's range (in blue) and cannot be behind an obstacle if the spell requires line of sight.</p>\n \n<p>Tip: You can add spell bars that will be visible in combat in the game options menu.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Combat Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>You can also achieve certain optional objectives during battles, called Challenges. They could, for example, require that you defeat all of your enemies in close combat, not use one of the spell elements (earth, air, fire or water), or finish off the enemies in a specific order. These challenges are displayed on the left of your screen and will give you experience and loot bonuses at the end of the fight, once you've won it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Combat Experience</h3>\n\n<p>At the end of combat, you'll gain experience, more commonly called \"XP\". This experience lets you level up and become stronger and stronger. There are multiple ways of gaining even more experience from combat:</p>\n \n<p>When a group of monsters hasn't been attacked for quite some time, bonus stars appear and give you an experience bonus of up to 200%. Each orange star gives a 20% bonus and red stars give 40%. Consider choosing monsters to fight based on these bonuses and heading to rarely visited areas in the game.</p>\n \n<p>Combat challenges give experience bonuses depending on their difficulty. These bonuses are calculated and displayed right when combat starts.</p>\n \n<p>If you have one or more characters on the same account who are at a higher level than the secondary character you're currently playing with, you'll also get an extra experience bonus as follows:</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li>1 character at a higher level: 100% bonus (XP ×2).</li>\n<li>2 characters at a higher level: 200% bonus (XP ×3).</li>\n<li>3 or more characters at a higher level: 300% bonus (XP ×4).</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>Your character's Wisdom, which can be increased with characteristics points gained at each level-up or with bonuses for equipped items, also lets you gain more experience points at the end of fights.</p>\n \n\n<h3>End-of-Combat Loot</h3>\n\n<p>Once you've defeated all of the enemy monsters, you'll also win end-of-combat loot – the higher your Prospecting, the more likely you are to get items.</p>\n \n<p>To increase your Prospecting, you can equip your character with items that give Prospecting bonuses. Putting characteristics points into Chance will also influence Prospecting: 10 Chance points increase your Prospecting by 1 point.</p>\n \n<p>Just like experience bonuses, you can also increase end-of-combat loot by completing challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The list of loot that you can get from a monster is visible from its card in the bestiary, with the chance of obtaining it as a percentage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus Packs</h3>\n\n<p>You can get a Bonus Pack in the game shop that allows you to level your character faster with a bonus of +150% extra experience and resources from combat.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Dying</h3>\n\n<p>Dying doesn't have any real effect on your character if your team wins the fight. You'll come out victorious, having lost nothing but easy-to-replace HP. However, any defeated characters on the team will lose energy points. When your energy bar hits 0, your character will respawn in a cemetery as a ghost, and you'll have to float your way to a Phoenix statue to be revived. The position of the nearest Phoenixes will be marked with red indicators on the mini-map and the world map.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use consumables like certain sweets, breads, or fish to regain energy.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you're offline, your character can rest and will regain energy passively. Recovery is faster if you log out in a tavern or house (yours or one belonging to a friend in your guild).</p>","ui.pseudoChoice.help":"This is the first time you have logged in to DOFUS TOUCH.\nChoose a nickname that suits you.\nIt will be the name displayed in-game and on the DOFUS TOUCH forums.","ui.helpWindow.category5sub4":"Papycha.fr, the Reference Fan Site","ui.helpWindow.category2sub9text":"<h3>Creating a Guild</h3>\n<p>You must have a Guildalogem to create a guild. It is a stone that is dropped randomly by all kinds of monsters or that can be acquired with a doploon of each class.\nHaving one of these stones allows you to access the Guild Hall at [0, -8].</p>\n\n<p>You will then have to go into the second room, then choose en emblem and a name for your guild for it to be created. Think carefully about the name you will give your guild; it cannot be changed afterwards. As for character names, accents and special characters are not allowed. On the other hand, spaces are allowed, although the number of characters is limited.</p>\n\n<p>A guild usually brings together people with the same ideals: merchants, crafters, warriors, roleplayers... Don't hesitate to be original!</p>\n\n<p>All of your server's guilds are shown in the directory that you will find in the game via the \"Guild\" button.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Managing a Guild</h3>\n\n<p>The guild's founder takes on the role of leader, which allows them to use all of the guild's management tools. They have the right to distribute and delegate their rights.\nThe main task of a leader will be to recruit people, because the more active people a guild has, the better-known it will become.</p>\n\n<p>The number of members a guild can accommodate is limited; a basic guild can accommodate 140 members. Then it can accomodate one more every time a guild levels up by 2 up to Level 200, until the maximum of 240 members are reached.</p>\n\n<h4>The Different Rights</h4>\n<p>There are, therefore, different rights that each member can acquire within the guild:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Manage boosts: gives permission to manage the use of acquired boost points for the Perceptor.</li>\n<li>Have full rights: gives full rights over the guild, just like the rights of the leader.</li>\n<li>Transmit rights: gives permission to give and remove only the rights held (except the right transmit rights).</li>\n<li>Invite new members: gives permission to invite new members to the guild.</li>\n<li>Ban: gives permission to exclude a member from the guild.</li>\n<li>Manage guildmates' XP contributions: gives permission to manage the percentage of XP of all guild members.</li>\n<li>Manage own XP contribution: gives permission to manage your own percentage of XP.</li>\n<li>Manage ranks: gives permission to change the rank of all guild members.</li>\n<li>Be the main Perceptor defender: gives permission to go over another player of a lower level when defending a Perceptor being attacked.</li>\n<li>Place a Perceptor: gives permission to Perceptor.</li>\n<li>Retrieve loot from Perceptors: gives permission to retrieve loot from all Perceptors.</li>\n<li>Retrieve loot from your Perceptors: gives permission to retrieve loot from only one Perceptor placed by the player.</li>\n<li>Can use paddocks: gives permission to use guild paddocks to evolve your Dragoturkeys.</li>\n<li>Arrange the paddocks: gives permission to place or remove breeding items in guild paddocks.</li>\n<li>Manage other members' mounts: gives permission to take a guild friend's Dragoturkey when it is in a guild paddock.</li>\n<li>Speak in the Alliance channel: allows using the Alliance channel (/a) to speak. Not having this right does not prevent you from reading the channel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please note that there are different ranks that can be broken down as follows: Trial, Dogsbody, Reservist, Craftsman, Protector, Treasurer, Second in Command, and Leader. But there is also: Perceptor Killer, Mascot, Penitent, Nuisance, Deserter, Torturer, Merchant, Breeder, Recruiting Officer, Mentor, Guide, Chosen One, Counsellor, Muse, Governor, Murderer, Initiate, Thief, Treasure Hunter, Poacher, Traitor, Pet Killer, Secretary, Diplomat, Spy, Scout, and finally Guard. These have no influence on rights; they just make it possible to pinpoint one member in relation to another. So that guild members are organised perfectly, you should, of course, use the first rank list.</p>\n\n<h4>Guild Evolution</h4>\n<p>Giving a percentage of experience taken from the fights of guild members, as well as the experience points collected by the Perceptor, allows the guild to evolve. Increasing the number of Perceptors that can be placed, their health points and their elemental resistances goes hand in hand with increasing the guild's level.</p>\n\n\n<h4>Giving Experience to the Guild</h4>\n<p>Guild evolution is possible thanks to players giving it experience. This experience is given according to a specific pattern.\nThe percentage given is taken from your entire experience during a fight. Thus a fight giving 10,000 XP carried out with 50% experience given to the guild will give only 5,000, since 50% is for the guild.\nHowever, this 5,000 XP will not go to the guild as it is; only 10% of this figure can possibly go to the guild.\nIn our example, there is therefore 500 XP that can be recovered.</p>\n\n<p>It is necessary to compare the player's level with the guild to find out the exact experience given. This is because the closer the player's level is to that of the guild, the closer they will get to the maximum possible XP that can be given. Conversely, if a player is more than 70 levels away from that of the guild, the XP they can possibly give to the guild will be lowered by 10%.</p>\n\n<p>Let's compare two players from a level-30 guild who were in a fight that gave 10,000 XP and 50% guild XP.\nA level-30 player will give 500 XP.\nA level-100 player will give 50 XP.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, both players will participate equally in the guild, as a high-level player can participate in fights earning much more experience. However, to give as much, a high-level player will have to miss out on ten times more experience.</p>\n\n<h3>Perceptors</h3>\n<p>At each additional level reached by the guild, it is awarded five boost points that are used to give Perceptors new skills. It is possible to give them spells so that they can defend themselves a little better. Increasing a Perceptor's spell by one level costs five boost points. There are different types of boostable spells, such as:</p>\n\n<p><b>Defensive spells:</b> Aqueous Shield, Earth Shield, Glowing Shield, Wind Shield.</p>\n\n<p><b>Attack spells:</b> Rock, Flame, Wave, Cyclone.</p>\n\n<p><b>Support spells:</b> Healing Word, Unbewitchment, Mass Compulsion, Destabilisation.</p>\n\n<p>You can also invest points in Perceptor skills, either by increasing its wisdom (1 point = 1 Wisdom point) so that it gives the guild better XP, investing in prospecting (1 point = 1 Prospecting point) so that it helps to drop better, investing in its pods so that it can carry more items (1 point = 20 pods), or investing in the maximum number of Perceptors that your guild can place (10 points = 1 extra Perceptor).</p>\n\n<h4>Summoning a Perceptor</h4>\n<p>To summon a Perceptor, you must use a Perceptor Summoning Potion, have the right to use it, and have reached level 50.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out the number of kamas, the experience and items that can be collected with Perceptors by talking to them or hovering over their icon in the \"Perceptors' guild interface. The items collected by it will be valued using the sale price in merchant modes and the average sale price at the Marketplace.</p>\n\n<h4>Perceptor Collection</h4>\n<p>The main role of Perceptors is to collect items, resources, kamas, and experience. Their collection probabilities can be boosted with the boost points obtained at each guild level change.\nIf a mistake is made, it is possible to unboost Perceptors using specific delevelling potions. However, as they are made from Guildalogems, this is very expensive to do.\nA Perceptor can be collected from at any time by those who have the right to do so. However, a Perceptor that has been collected from will disappear and can be placed on the same map again only after (guild level) × 10 min (for a level-35 guild, for example, it will be 350 minutes).</p>\n\n<p>Collecting items/kamas: allows the Perceptor placed in an area to have a chance (thanks to the Prospecting system) of dropping items and kamas through the fights in progress in the area where it is.</p>\n\n<p>Collecting experience: allows the Perceptor placed in an area to create experience (thanks to the Wisdom system) through the fights in progress in the area where it is. Wisdom does not accumulate directly in the guild after fights; it must be collected, just like drops.</p>\n\n<p>All of the Perceptors in the area will, therefore, share the resources generated.\nThis means that for each fight taking place in the area, resources will be generated (based on the average Prospecting of the Perceptors in the area) and will then be distributed to the Perceptors present in proportion to their Prospecting (a Perceptor who on its own will have 10% of the total Prospecting of the Perceptors in the area will statistically gain 10% of the resources generated for the Perceptors in each fight).</p>\n\n<h4>Perceptor Attack</h4>\n<p>If you decide to attack a Perceptor to steal its loot, there are a few things to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fights take place with five defenders + the Perceptor against five attackers.</li>\n<li>The attackers must place themselves and not see the defenders before they join the fight; the defenders can place themselves, but the attackers more so.</li>\n<li>All guild alliance members who own the Perceptor can come to its defence.</li>\n<li>Multi-accounting is no longer allowed: it is forbidden.</li>\n<li>There is a compulsory wait of one hour between Perceptor attacks.</li>\n<li>Defenders can view the attackers' classes, levels and appearances in their guild's \"Perceptor\" tab or via the message in the Alliance and Guild channels.</li>\n<li>Defending a Perceptor does not make pets lose points or defenders lose energy (but very much so for the attackers!).</li>\n<li>Losing while defending a Perceptor teleports you to your recall point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Guild Paddocks and Houses</h3>\n<p>Ever since the introduction of Dragoturkeys, it has been possible for guilds to own one or more guild paddocks in order to breed their mounts. Starting from level 10 (and if it has existed for more than two months), the guild can buy a paddock through its leader. All 10 guild levels, you have the opportunity to buy a new paddock.\nObviously, the leader decides who can take care of the paddocks and mounts to avoid any intra-guild problems by using the rights system.</p>\n\n<p>You can quickly access your paddock(s) using potions that can be crafted by alchemists:\n\n1× Home Potion + 1× Blop Flower of each kind (Pippin, Coconut, Morello Cherry, and Indigo).</p>\n\n<p>After using this potion, you will go to the guild interface that will allow you to choose which paddock you want to be teleported to.</p>\n\n<p>It is also possible to share one or more houses in a guild. Actually, if a member owns a house, he or she can associate it to the guild via the interface available inside the house. They can also manage how it is used as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>House visible or not to guild members</li>\n<li>Emblem visible or not to the guild (only guild members can see the emblem on the house)</li>\n<li>Emblem visible or not to all</li>\n<li>Guild members have access</li>\n<li>Non-guild members have no access</li>\n<li>Teleportation allowed or not to this house using the relevant potion</li>\n<li>Guild members may rest in this house</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As with faster access to paddocks, you can use another potion to get to a guild house in two mouse clicks. To do this, find an alchemist who will make you a Guild House Potion with this recipe:\n\n1× Home Potion + 1× Piece of Blop of each kind (Pippin, Coconut, Morello Cherry, and Indigo).</p>\n\n<p>And as with paddocks, the guild interface will allow you to choose which house you want to go to.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thank you to our friends from JeuxOnLine for this guide!</b></p>","ui.helpWindow.category2sub16text1":"<h3>Who Are Dopples?</h3>\n<p>Dopples are magical creatures that are associated with each class in DOFUS Touch.

Here's how to report them.</p>\n\n<h4>Via the DOFUS Touch Discord</h4>\n\n<p>This is certainly the simplest and quickest method. No need to take screenshots or anything – it only takes 10 seconds! You will first have to join our Discord by clicking on <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/gXmbfng\">this link.</a> Once on the server, you will see that a bot (how ironic!) is present on the right: BotReport. Then you just have to send it a private message to report the bot; for example, you just came across a bot named Nyom on the server Oshimo. You will have to send the following message to BotReport: \"<i>Bot Nyom Oshimo</i>\".</p>\n \n<ul>\n<li>\"Bot\" signals the report.</li>\n<li>\"Nyom\" is the exact nickname of the bot.</li>\n<li>\"Oshimo\" is the server it's on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Be careful to indicate the exact nickname, otherwise your report cannot be processed. Our teams will then take care of making the necessary checks in the game (there is, therefore, no point in reporting your little brother to annoy him!).</p>\n\n<p>This method has been working and effective for several weeks and has allowed us to trace different bot networks – Thanks to all those who use it!</p>\n\n<h4>By Ankabox to a Moderator</h4>\n\n<p>This method is less effective, since the BotReport method allows you to contact the whole team at once; through Ankabox, you are only contacting a single person. In any case, your report will be processed!</p>\n\n<p>Just read <a href=\"https://www.dofus-touch.com/en/forum/29-general-discussion/3492-list-community-helpers-moderators\">this list</a> of moderators for each server and contact one of them accordingly. Avoid contacting several at once; this would waste everyone's time.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Reporting any Other Illicit Situation</h3>\n\n<p>Using an emulator, insults, phishing... This is how to report illicit behaviour to moderators.</p>\n\n<p>For each situation, it will be necessary to provide a valid screenshot: <a href=\"https://www.dofus-touch.com/fr/forum/83-moderation/16382-tutoriel-envoyer-capture-ecran-moderateur\">read this to find out more</a>.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Through Ankama Support</h4>\n\n<p>The Support team is able to deal with inappropriate behaviour and take the necessary measures. To do this, you just have to create a written request on its website.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Through the DOFUS Touch Discord</h4>\n\n<p>Confirmed moderators are present on the official Discord of the game. You can contact them via private message to report illicit behaviour. Don't forget to provide a valid screenshot.</p>\n\n<p>Preferably, contact your server's moderators; to get the list, type \"?modos\" in the Discord chat window.</p>\n\n<p>Again, avoid contacting multiple moderators at once to avoid wasting time dealing with already-resolved situations.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Through Ankabox</h4>\n\n<p>In the same manner as reporting a bot, you can opt for Ankabox by using <a href=\"https://www.dofus-touch.com/en/forum/29-general-discussion/3492-list-community-helpers-moderators\">this topic</a>.</p>\n \n\n<h3>Processing Time</h3>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that moderators have dozens of reports to process per day and that they are not machines – they will not be able to process all cases within the hour!</p>\n\n<p>If your report is made correctly and justified, it will be dealt with as soon as possible, no matter what happens. There is no need to contact multiple moderators at once.</p>\n\n\n<p>You now have all the cards in hand if you want to help us maintain a good atmosphere on the various servers!</p>","ui.helpWindow.category2sub1text":"<p>The world of DOFUS Touch is massive and has many surprises in store for you!

This specialisation can be learned with the NPC Hel Munster, at the Smithmagi's workshop in the Treechnid Forest. Once the skill is learned, the player must level it to increase its effectiveness, as with any other profession.</p>\n\n<h4>Changing the Element Used in a Weapon</h4>\n\n<p>What is commonly referred to as \"Elemental Smithmagic\" is the use of an elemental potion on a weapon with neutral damage to transform it into Fire, Water, Earth or Air damage. This transformation is accompanied by a decrease in the damage of the weapon, which varies according to the power of the potion used.\nThese potions can be created by alchemists from Kwak resources (weakest potions, 50% loss of damage), Scaraleaves (medium potions, 32% loss of damage) or Dreggons (most-powerful potions, 15% loss of damage).\nElementary Smithmagic does not work all the time, so it is sometimes necessary to repeat the transformation attempt several times for it to succeed. The reduction in weapon damage is applied only in the event of a successful transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Warning:\nAny elemental change is irreversible.\nOnly the classic damage of a weapon can be transformed. The element of a health steal, even neutral, cannot be modified.\nIf a weapon has several neutral damage lines, the element of all these damage lines will be transformed at the same time. It isn't possible to change several lines on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Changing the Characteristics of an Item</h4>\n\n<p>The other Smithmagic skill changes the characteristics given by an item. This allows you to change the value of one or more features on an item whose crafting bonuses seem too low to you compared to the natural maximum possible. It is also possible to exceed these natural maximums (we call this an \"overmax\"), or even to give items characteristics that are not present by default (we call this \"exotic Smithmagic\"; for example, adding an MP to a Gelano), although it is much more complex.</p>\n\n<h4>Which Smithmagic for Which Item?</h4>\n\n<p>There are 11 Smithmagic professions: Sword Smithmagus, Bow Carvmagus, Hammer Smithmagus, Shoemagus (belts and boots), Jewelmagus (amulets and rings), Dagger Smithmagus, Staff Carvmagus, Wand Carvmagus, Shovel Smithmagus, Costumagus (headgear and capes) and Axe Smithmagus. The only equipment crafting profession with no specialisation is Shield Smith.</p>\n\n<p>Each profession allows you to forge a specific type of item. It is therefore necessary to contact a specific type of artisan depending on the item you want to smithmage. Even the best Costumagus in the World of Twelve will have a hard time smithmaging your boots or axe.</p>\n \n\n<h4>What Are AP, RA, DA, PROSPE, WIS Runes?</h4>\n\n<p>Smithmaging items requires the use of runes. There is one type of rune per characteristic and several power levels (normal runes, Ap runes, Ra runes). We will therefore use, for example, Dam runes to increase the damage of an item, Agi runes for agility, and Prospe runes for Prospecting. The more powerful the rune used, the more the value of the characteristic will be increased. The value of runes varies according to the characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Runes can be obtained by breaking items using the crushers in the Smithmagi's workshops. The type of runes obtained depends on the characteristics of the item crushed. The higher the characteristic on the item, the more likely the equivalent rune obtained will be powerful. Each rune has a specific \"weight\", which depends on its bonus type and power. This weight will influence the bonus losses in case of Neutral Success and Critical Failure (see opposite).</p>\n\n<p>The total weight of the characteristics of the item, on the other hand, will influence the success rate of Smithmagings (the closer the bonuses of an item are to their maximum value, the lower the success rate).</p>\n\n<h4>Smithmagic Doesn't Work Every Time!</h4>\n\n<p>Once the runes and the item are ready, the Smithmagus must combine them using the magic anvil present in the Smithmagi's workshops (it will never be able to advise players sufficiently to use the cooperative crafting system rather than to entrust their items and runes to artisans). The higher your Smithmagic level, the higher your success rate will be and the more you'll be able to modify high-level items. Be careful, however: even at level 100, the success rate is not 100% and failure is common, so you will have to repeat the task as many times as necessary until you get the bonuses of your dreams.</p>\n\n<p>More precisely, there are three possible results of Smithmaging an item:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Success: the rune works and increases the desired characteristic without altering the other characteristics.</li>\n<li>Neutral Success: the rune increases the desired characteristic but one or more other characteristics are significantly reduced.</li>\n<li>Critical Failure: the rune doesn't work, no characteristics are increased and several characteristics are reduced (the total value of losses depends on the weight of the rune used).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In case of Neutral Success or Critical Failure, the value of the loss of characteristics depends on the power of the rune used and the current state of the item. The success rate of a Smithmaging is also affected by the current power of the item – it is very easy to increase the characteristics of an item whose bonuses are low or medium compared to their maximum value; the success rate decreases significantly as soon as the bonuses of the item approach these maximums (the lowest critical success rate when using a rune, excluding \"overmax\" or \"exotic Smithmagic\" attempts, is 15%).</p>\n\n<p>The success rate of exotic Smithmagic, on the other hand, is automatically very low and can be as low as 1% if you want to add an exotic AP or MP, for example.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Limitations of Exotic Smithmagic</h4>\n\n<p>Some exotic Smithmagic is deliberately made impossible. For example, it is not possible to add an AP or MP to an item that already has these bonuses.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, AP, MP and Range exotic Smithmagic is limited to the character level. In fact, in the case of a character with several items with these exotic bonuses, only 1 AP, 1 MP and 1 Range will be counted. The items can be equipped normally but the extra exotic bonus will not be reflected in the character's characteristics.</p>\n \n\n<h4>Residual Magic, Wells or Relics?</h4>\n\n<p>When using a rune, the characteristics loss value in case of Neutral Success and Critical Failure is generally equal to the weight of the rune used. In some cases, however, the characteristics loss value will be greater than the value of the weight of the rune. This is how residual magic is created on an item, which is also called a \"Well\" or a \"Relic\".</p>\n\n<p>Residual magic is an invisible characteristic on an item whose value is equal to the difference between the value of the losses (during a Critical Failure or a Neutral Success) and that of the weight of the rune used. When a well has thus been created on an item, the following Failures will lower the value of the item, protecting the rest of the characteristics of the item. This is commonly referred to as \"tapping\" (into a well).</p>\n\n<p>Warning: In the case of an item with an \"overmax\" characteristic or an exotic bonus, the losses will apply to these characteristics before tapping into the residual magic, unless the rune used is of the same type as the \"overmax\" or exotic characteristic.</p>\n\n<p>Warning messages appear in the discussion window when residual magic is created on an item (+ relic) and when a loss has tapped into it (- relic).</p>\n\n<p>Warning: Equipping an item, as well as putting it on sale in a Marketplace, makes it lose all its residual magic (on the other hand, it is preserved in case of exchange or logging out).</p>\n \n\n<h4>A Good Smithmagus Must First Accept Randomness</h4>\n\n<p>Finally, although the most-experienced artisans develop an increased knowledge of the Smithmagic system with time and know very well how to modify an item to get what they want, Smithmagic remains a profession that is particularly affected by randomness. Knowing this, it is up to each player not to take too many risks or to be too greedy when wanting to improve, unless they are ready to suffer losses and to start the changes over from the beginning!</p>","ui.helpWindow.category4sub1text":"<ul><li>A</li></ul>\n<ul>\n<li>AFK: Away from keyboard.

Each completed challenge will give you a certain number of points.</p>\n\n<p>For each challenge completed during a fight, a fixed \"combo\" bonus is added to the fight score according to the scale below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 challenge completed = 0 bonus points</li>\n<li>2 challenges completed = 15 bonus points</li>\n<li>3 challenges completed = 30 bonus points</li>\n<li>4 challenges completed = 50 bonus points</li>\n<li>5 challenges completed = 75 bonus points</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Survival</h3>\n\n<p>Your score will suffer a penalty every time a teammate dies in a fight. Resurrection effects cannot remove this penalty.</p>\n\n<p>However, death after being resurrected will not raise the penalty (if a player dies, is revived, then dies again, the penalty will apply only once).</p>\n\n<p>The score will be validated at the end of each threshold. Once all three fights in a threshold have been completed, the scores from the fights will be validated and saved. If you don't manage to complete a threshold, the scores from the completed floors will not be saved.</p>\n\n<h3>Improving Scores</h3>\n\n<p>With each new rotation, you'll receive eight items that allow you to return to a previously completed threshold in order to improve your score there.</p>\n\n<p>These items are available in limited quantities, so you'll only be able to improve certain thresholds. It's up to you to choose which ones to improve to get the best final score. You can use them in both Classic and Nightmare mode.</p>\n\n<p>As with initial score validation, you'll need to complete the entire threshold in order to validate the scores for the three floors.</p>\n\n<p>Only the best overall score from the threshold is saved. This way, if your attempt at improvement turns out to be less satisfactory than the initial validation, your score will not be lowered.</p>\n\n<p>If two players' scores are tied, the first one to have achieved that score will be better ranked. Therefore, it is worth starting your ascension early to guarantee yourself the best place possible in the event of a tie.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of a tie in both scores and times, for example if the players were on the same team, they will all obtain the same ranking. This way, if three players perform the entire ascension together and finish in first place in the rankings, all three will receive the rewards for Top 1.</p>","ui.achievement.achievedBySomeoneElse":"This success has been validated by another of your characters on this server.","ui.cleanAssets.description":"Verification and deletion of unused assets in your device's cache.","ui.cleanAssets.title":"Verifying cached assets.","ui.bidhouse.catLairBadges":"Lair Badges","ui.criterion.cosmeticItemSlot":"The %1 slot must be occupied.","ui.criterion.cosmeticItemSlotType":"The equipped item type must match %1.","ui.shield.interfaceTitle":"Shields","ui.mount.impossibleDataPrivateFarm":"This paddock is private.

The higher the floor number, the higher the level of the monsters you'll encounter.</p>\n\n<p>Your goal is to complete as many floors as possible in order to collect the most rewards and get the highest score possible.</p>\n\n<p>Changing characters, losing a fight or exiting in the middle of a threshold will require you to start the threshold over from its first floor the next time you attempt it.</p>\n\n<p>If you are stopped (or if you lose a fight) in the middle of a threshold, you will be able to continue your progress right from the floor you were at using your goultines (200) with the NPC at the entrance or from the end-of-fight screen when you lose. The score you achieved on the previous floors of the current threshold will then be kept.</p>\n\n<p>1 to 3 players can take part in Ascension Island fights together. The monster groups you'll face consist of four or five opponents.</p>\n\n<p>The use of more than two accounts by any one player in Ascension Island combats is forbidden.</p>\n\n<h3>Difficulty</h3>\n\n<p>Ascension Island is available in two difficulties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Classic mode features monsters at levels 75 to 200.</li>\n<li>Nightmare mode features monsters at levels 200 to 325.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to unlock \"Nightmare\" mode from the NPC at the entrance, you will first need to complete all 50 floors in Classic mode.</p>\n\n<p>Once Nightmare mode is unlocked, you can enter Ascension Island again and try to work your way through the 50 floors.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works the same way as it does in Classic mode, but the monster families you encounter are different and the rewards are greater.</p>\n\n<h3>Rotations</h3>\n\n<p>Roughly every two months, the content of Ascension Island is reset in order to change how the monster families are distributed across thresholds, and also how the combat area is laid out. However, for maps where you face bosses, the starting obstacles and placements remain the same for all rotations.</p>\n\n<p>During a single rotation, all players encounter the same monsters on the same floors and at the same levels.

The technique consists of making the victim believe that he or she is on a trusted website in order to get personal information from him or her.</p>\n \n<p>\"Phishing\" websites are sites that copy the appearance and interface of the Ankama Games websites more or less accurately in order to steal your login details from you. They usually offer you loads of fantastic things (kamas, levels, items, etc.).</p>\n \n<p>Most phishing sites have inconsistencies. They have a lot of spelling mistakes and/or a flawed layout. If the site has only a few web pages or if it displays extremely tempting propositions, it is probably a trap.</p>\n \n<p>Be extremely careful with these websites!

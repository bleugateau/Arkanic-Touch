## Arkanic (Proof of Concept)
This is an ugly reproduction of the game server of the mobile game Dofus Touch (Ankama) in NodeJs with ES6 (a lot of bad practice, that was my first ES6 app).
Stars repos for more :heart:

## Installation

 1. Install dependencies:

For npm:
> npm install

If you use yarn
> yarn install

 2. Install database in MySQL server.
 3. Configure file config/config.js with your MYSQL informations
 4. If you have change AUTH_PORT value in config/config.js you need to change this line in config/config.json:

actual:

    "dataUrl": "http://localhost:3000",  
    "haapi": {  
      "id": 18,  
      "url": "https://haapi.ankama.com/json/Ankama/v2",  
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/haapi",  
      "hostname": "ankama.com"  
    },


 by 

    "dataUrl": "http://localhost:YOUR AUTH PORT",  
    "haapi": {  
      "id": 18,  
      "url": "https://haapi.ankama.com/json/Ankama/v2",  
      "url": "http://localhost:YOUR AUTH PORT/haapi",  
      "hostname": "ankama.com"  
    },

5. Now you can run the server:

For yarn:
> yarn build

For npm:
>npm build
